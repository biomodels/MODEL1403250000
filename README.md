# Model Notes

    
    
    This represents the reduced version of the "time course model" of Van Eunen et al (2013): Biochemical competition makes fatty-acid beta-oxidation vulnerable to substrate overload. The SBML was created from that of the original model and produces identical results when a time-course of 25 mins is run in COPASI
